***SPECIAL THANK TO SYLVAIN LEFLON FOR ITS HELP ***

This project consists of a interactive guitar player, using html, css and javascript.
To play, you need to select notes on the fretboard, which is localized in the middle of the screen, and then strum on the strings by using your mouse pointer.
It is possible to save the chords you are playing, and switch between them by clicking on their labels.
To help visually, the strings are associated to the frets matching their colors.
At the bottom of the screen, you can find a audio spectrum that matches what is currently being played, and the general waveform of the sound.
